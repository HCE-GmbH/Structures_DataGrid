I - Introduction

The Structures_DataGrid and Structures_DataGrid_Column API documentation in the 
PEAR manual is generated from :
- doc blocks in the source
- examples in the docs/examples/ folder that are linked into the doc blocks with @example tags

To add explanation, description, etc... to a method entry in the manual, just add 
comments in its doc block in the source.

To add an example to a given method, add a tag to its doc block like :
@example    my-example.php      My Example

And then create a file named my-example.php in the docs/examples/ directory

II - Generate the documentation

Note: This has been tested on Linux with PhpDocumentor 1.3.0RC6

1 - Change your current directory to the Structures_DataGrid root directory 
(where you checked it out from CVS)

2 - run tools/manual/mkmanual.sh <peardoc_path> 

Where peardoc_path is the CVS PEAR manual root (where you have checked out the 
whole PEAR manual source)

This will 
    - build the documentation with phpDocumentor, merging the examples files
    - copy (replace) the newly generated files into the pear manual file tree

It will only modify the files in : 
- en/package/structures/structures-datagrid/structures-datagrid/
- en/package/structures/structures-datagrid/structures-datagrid-column/

Modifying the Structures_DataGrid front page, constants, etc... is up to you.

3 - then rebuild the manual as usual
